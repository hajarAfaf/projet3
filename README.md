ðŸŒŒ Deep Learning-Based Star-Galaxy Classification
This Jupyter Notebook implements a Deep Learning model using CNNs and TensorFlow to classify celestial objects as Stars or Galaxies.

ðŸ“Œ Dataset: Real telescope images collected from a 1.3m telescope in Nainital, India
ðŸ“Œ Goal: To develop an AI model that can identify whether an image contains a Star or a Galaxy
ðŸ“Œ Methods Used: Image Processing, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), Grad-CAM visualization
